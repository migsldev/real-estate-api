# Real Estate Listing and Management Platform

## Project Overview

The Real Estate Listing and Management Platform is a full-stack application designed to facilitate the browsing, listing, and management of real estate properties. The platform supports two main types of users: property owners/agents and potential renters/buyers. Property owners can list and manage properties, while renters/buyers can browse listings, apply for properties, and manage their favorite properties.

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization
- Registration and login for users (property owners and renters/buyers)
- Role-based access control

### Property Management
- Property owners can create, update, and delete property listings
- Display property listings with details such as title, description, price, and location

### Application Management
- Renters/buyers can apply to properties
- Property owners can view, approve, or reject applications

### Wishlist (Favorites)
- Renters/buyers can add properties to their wishlist
- Renters/buyers can remove properties from their wishlist

### Property Search and Filtering
- Users can search for properties based on criteria like location, price, and other attributes

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Flask**: For creating the RESTful API
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database interactions and ORM
- **Marshmallow**: For data serialization and validation
- **JWT**: For user authentication

### Frontend
- **React**: For building the user interface
- **Redux**: For state management
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the API
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing user and property data

## Project Structure

### Backend (Flask API)
- **User Model**: username, email, password
  - Role: Agent/Property owner or Potential renter/buyer
- **Property Model**: title, description, price, location, listed_by (user ID)
- **Application Model**: user_id, property_id, status (pending, approved, rejected)
- **Wishlist Model**: user_id, property_id

#### Relationships:
- Many-to-Many between users and properties through the Wishlist model
- One-to-Many between users and properties (a user can list multiple properties)
- One-to-Many between users and applications (a user can apply to multiple properties)

#### Endpoints:
- User registration, login, and profile management
- CRUD operations on properties
- Managing applications (apply, approve, reject)
- Managing wishlist (add/remove favorites)

### Frontend (React)
- **Authentication**:
  - User registration and login forms
  - Role-based navigation (different views for property owners and renters/buyers)
- **Property Management**:
  - Forms for creating and updating property listings
  - Dashboard for property owners to manage their listings
- **Property Listings**:
  - Display list of properties with search and filtering options
  - Property detail view with option to apply for the property
- **Applications**:
  - Dashboard for renters/buyers to track their applications
  - Dashboard for property owners to view, approve, or reject applications
- **Wishlist**:
  - View and manage favorite properties

#### Client-side Routes (React Router)
1. **/register**: User registration page
2. **/login**: User login page
3. **/properties**: List of all properties with search and filtering options
4. **/properties/:id**: Property detail view with option to apply for the property
5. **/dashboard**: Dashboard for property owners to manage their listings and applications

## New Feature: Real-time Notifications
- Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets to notify users when their application status changes (e.g., application approved or rejected).

## Steps to Get Started

### Backend Development:
1. Set up the Flask project and create the database models
2. Implement the API endpoints and test them using Postman
3. Add authentication and authorization using JWT
4. Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets (e.g., Flask-SocketIO)

### Frontend Development:
1. Set up the React project and install necessary dependencies
2. Create the authentication forms and integrate with the API
3. Build the property listing pages and integrate search/filter functionality
4. Implement forms and dashboards for property management
5. Build the application and wishlist management features
6. Implement real-time notifications using a library like Socket.IO

### Integration:
1. Connect the frontend with the backend API using Axios
2. Test the full application flow from user registration to property management

### Deployment:
1. Deploy the backend on a platform like Heroku or AWS
2. Deploy the frontend on a platform like Netlify or Vercel
3. Set up a PostgreSQL database instance for production

By following this plan, you'll build a complete full-stack application that showcases your skills in both backend and frontend development. This project will also give you a practical understanding of working with APIs, managing state in a frontend application, handling user authentication and authorization, and implementing real-time features.
